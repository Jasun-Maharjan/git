            How technology plays a vital role in watch designs and watch sales<br><br>
        </h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%">
            Watches are ancient accessory that was first introduced during 15th century by Peter Henlein but as time has
            passed, and
            like every other thing that has advanced, watches have advanced too and now we can get smartwatches that are
            able to make phone calls, which no one in the 15th century had even imagined was possible. Like watches,
            technology has also been growing rapidly and people think that there is no impact of technology in watches
            till now but they are totally wrong. <br><br>
            Technology plays a vital role in bringing old and forgotten trends into light again. Watches are by no means
            forgotten
            but tech can play a vital role in making watches more popular by introducing them to more people. This can
            help in
            the increment of watch market. Through tech, watches can be made in a short period of time in comparison to
            how they were traditionally made.
            Traditionally, a watch would take a couple of days to make but now in a couple of hour, watches can be mass
            created. This can help watchmaker's economy status by a ton which can lead to a nation's economic increase.
            And by the use of e-commerce, watches can be supplied
            and demanded from anywhere in the world which makes it easy for the supplier and the consumer to buy and
            sell. <br><br>
            For sales management, there are infinite possibilities that can happen with the help of technology,
            implementing
            technology into sales would make the sky your limit. And when watches get massive sales, it will lead to the
            watches
            gaining popularity and getting famous which will also lead to many more sales down the line.<br><br>
            In terms of design, watches has come a long way. In 15th century, the watches couldnt even be worn but now
            we can make phone calls as well as do various tasks like clicking picture, recording voices, measuring
            heartbeat
            and measuring fat burned too. The technology has affected watches greatly, traditionally, watches were made
            to only measure time but now not only can watches measure time and date, it can measure your health
            condition and
            do things that no onw could have thought of.
